/**
 * Renderer semantics guard ("Magic Context owns the sidebar semantics").
 *
 * The bridge-side half of this guard lives in `omp-sidepanel-bridge`, and the
 * vocabulary both halves defend is defined once in `sidepanel-semantics/src`.
 * This repo cannot reach either of those: it is its own repository, and
 * cloning it must not require the monorepo. So it defends against the portable
 * copy — `tests/fixtures/sidepanel-semantics.json` — which the bridge
 * regenerates (`npm run update:semantics`) and verifies is byte-identical to
 * the module it came from.
 *
 * The rule it enforces here is narrow and specific to a renderer: Atelier draws
 * what it is given, so the moment it *authors* a word Magic Context chose — a
 * fallback label, a default section title, a placeholder for a missing value —
 * the two hosts can disagree while every other test still passes. That is the
 * failure this file exists to make impossible.
 *
 * Words, but not marks. The snapshot separates the producer's words from the
 * glyphs it draws with, because putting a glyph on a screen is precisely this
 * layer's job — the first run of this guard found three of its own (`█` `░`
 * `✓`) and was right to. The bridge, which only chooses primitives, bans both.
 *
 * Only the renderer surface is scanned. Atelier's own vocabulary ("Tokens",
 * node kinds, role names) is not producer vocabulary, and none of it is in the
 * banned list.
